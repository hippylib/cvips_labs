This page collects the *Jupyter notebooks* used for the graduate course on **Computational and Variational Methods for Inverse Problems**, taught by Prof. Ghattas at UT Austin in the Spring 2023 semester.

### hIPPYlib (Inverse Problems Python library)

The teaching material below uses [hIPPYlib](https://hippylib.github.io). hIPPYlib implements state-of-the-art scalable algorithms for PDE-based deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems.
It builds on [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org) (a parallel finite element element library) for the discretization of the partial differential equations and on [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/)
for scalable and efficient linear algebra operations and solvers.

### A few important logistics:

- The teaching material consists of cloud-based interactive tutorials that mix instruction and theory with editable and runnable code. You can run the codes presented in class through your web browser. This will allow anyone to test our software and experiment with inverse problem algorithms quite easily, without running into installation issues or version discrepancies. Instructions to connect to the cloud resources, username and password will be posted on Canvas. Please do not exchange the user info.

- If you are curious to learn more about PDEs, finite element methods, and FEniCS, the fastest way to start learning this tool is to download and read the first chapter of the FEniCS book from here. Note the updated/new FEniCS tutorial version here. For more detailed instructions, please check out the ‘‘Getting started with FEniCS’’ document available [here](files/fenics_getting_started.pdf).
